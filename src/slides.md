# Front-end Group Lunch & Learn

what we do | what we done | what we doing

##### what we do
> A group of indomitable, unscrupulous individuals whose undying devotion for pixelation, empowerment and "this week's framework" has led them on a valiant quest to alter the front-end landscape at MMT Digital. That is to say — we shove our code-driven pixels into your eyeholes harder than anyone else.
> <cite>Jarryd Trokis</cite>

##### what we do
> Seriously, we want to help make the front-end development experience at MMT Digital cleaner, more robust and wholly consistent across projects, whilst still allowing for project innovation.

# what we done

---

## Skills Base

Front-end skill sets are very broad. Front-end developers are sensitive souls. We created separate categories for HTML, styling, JavaScript, React and Node, to help project managers identify who is strong in what areas. This also provides a target for front-end developers to work to.

---

## Recruitment

Last year, we hired over 40 front-end developers! Most will have been hired using a more streamlined process that the front-end group championed last year. We also re-wrote the technical test, which has led to easier decisions about candidates and now requires **zero time for a developer to set the test up**.

---

## `Gatbsy + Contentful || Kentico Cloud`

We SPIKE'd out the use of Gatsby JS in combination with Contentful and Kentico Cloud. This lead to BSS, our first static site. There are also currently at least two Kentico Cloud sites in the pipeline. **Static is the future for front-end — you heard it here first.**

---

# Webpack this, Webpack that.

We released our first "generator". This allows front-end projects to be boilerplated in a matter of minutes. We now have over 5 projects at MMT Digital using this front-end setup.

# Open source model

You've heard of **open source** right?

Imagine a world where code at MMT was freely shared amongst developers. Where everyone is able to contribute to that code and where version management was as easy as running a command.
