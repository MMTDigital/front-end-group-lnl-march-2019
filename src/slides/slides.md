##### what we do
> A group of indomitable, unscrupulous individuals whose undying devotion for pixelation, empowerment and "this week's framework" has led them on a valiant quest to alter the front-end landscape at MMT Digital. That is to say ‚Äî we shove our code-driven pixels into your eyeholes harder than anyone else.
> <cite>Jarryd Trokis</cite>

---

##### what we do
> Seriously, we want to help make the front-end development experience at MMT Digital cleaner, more robust and wholly consistent across projects, whilst still allowing for project innovation.

# what we done

---

## Recruitment

Last year, we hired over **40** front-end developers! Most will have been hired using a more streamlined process that the front-end group championed last year. We also re-wrote the technical test, which has led to easier decisions about candidates and now requires **zero time for a developer to set the test up**.

---

## Skills Base

Front-end skill sets are very broad. Front-end developers are sensitive souls. We created separate categories for HTML, styling, JavaScript, React and Node, to help project managers identify who is strong in what areas. This also provides a target for front-end developers to work to.

## `Gatbsy + Contentful || Kentico Cloud`

We SPIKE'd out the use of Gatsby JS in combination with Contentful and Kentico Cloud. This lead to BSS, our first static site. There are also currently at least two Kentico Cloud sites in the pipeline.

**Static is the future for front-end.**

**You heard it here first.**

---

# Webpack this, Webpack that.

We released our first "generator". This allows front-end projects to be boilerplated in a matter of minutes. We now have over 5 projects at MMT Digital using this front-end setup.

# what we doing

---

## Restructuring.

We're now in the *technical department*.

We have a new sibling ‚Äî **Server-side Group**.

‚öôÔ∏è

---

## Planning.

We're now using Jira for our plans.

We also do quarterly planning.

üìö

---

## Open sourcing.

You've heard of **open source**, right?

Imagine a world where code at MMT was freely shared amongst developers, where everyone is able to contribute to that code and where version management was as easy as running a command.

üí°

---

## Immediate objective.

To build out an "component library", which has a goal of improving efficiency and normalising standards across our Kentico projects specifically to begin with.

‚è≥

---

## A sneak peek.

Removing the headache of front-end build tools, the front-end group has built a series of NPM packages housing Webpack and linting rules that we recommend.

## Documenting.

Your one-stop-shop for all things front-end at MMT Digital: our practices, our tools and our passion will reside in one place. We'd love it if you contribute.

# One more thing...

---

## Our wolfpack just grew by one.

We've had several interested developers write in declaring their interest, but we can only take on one additional member at the moment.

But *who is it*?
